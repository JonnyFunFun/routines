		Welcome to Routines!
		********************
        
		Routines is a simple package that provides a single decorator for you to mark 
		functions as tasks (routines) that should be executed on a regular schedule.
                
		To use, simply do the following::
	
			from routines import Routine
	
			@Routine(60)
			def my_routine_task(b):
				print b
	
			my_routine_task('Hello!')
			my_routine_task('Yay!')
	
		As a result of the above, "Hello!" and "Yay!" will print every 60 seconds.
